# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualiser

Dijkstra's algorithm is a way of finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. This application is built with react and visualises how the algorithm visits nodes before determining the shortest way of getting from a start node to an end node. I decided to build this project to get a deeper understanding of how this path finding algorithm works. It was heavily inspired by other path finding projects on GitHub and I intend to add more pathfinding algorithms to the project in due course. You can access the application here: [http://dijkstras.prabodhkakodkar.com](http://dijkstras.prabodhkakodkar.com).
